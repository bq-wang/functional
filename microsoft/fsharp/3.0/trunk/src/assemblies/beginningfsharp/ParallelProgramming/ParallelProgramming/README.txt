since the advent of the multi-core programming, we are embracing more and more parralel programmming


we can break down the topic of Parallel programming into serveral smaller subtopics. all of which you will learn about this chapter


Threads, Memory, Locking, and Blocking: You’ll learn about basic techniques for creating and controlling threads in .NET programming.
Reactive programming: It’s often important to the user experience that programs remain reactive to input.
Data parallelism: This term refers to executing one piece of code concurrently on several processors with varying input data.
Asynchronous programming:  Some tasks, particularly I/O, need to happen asynchronously to  make program execution efficient.
Message passing: This technique is more formally referred to as the actor model.
